Software Testing
=================

=> The Process of verifying and validation application functionalities is called as Software Testing.

=> Software Testing will happen in multiple stages

	1) Unit Testing
	2) System Integration Testing (SIT)
	3) User Acceptance Testing

Unit Testing : Testing individual components of the application.

Note: Developers will perform unit testing by using Junit.

SIT : Testing team will perform system integration testing.

Note: Identified bugs will be reported using JIRA.

UAT : User acceptance testing. client or client side team will test our application before delivery (acceptance testing).

Note: Based on UAT client will decide GO or No-GO.

=> Go means it is green signal from client to deploy in production.

=> No-GO means client identified some issues in UAT hence production deployment got cancelled.

===============================
What is Performance Testing ?
===============================

=> It is used to test stability and responsiveness of the application.

		1) how many users can access our application at a time

		2) For 100 users what is avg response time ?

		3) For 1000 users what is avg response time ?
		...

		4) For 1 lakh users what is avg response time ?

		5) What is bottleneck / failure point of our application

Note: To implement performance testing we will use tools.

		a) JMETER (open source)

		b) HP Load Runner (licensed)


==========
JMETER
==========

-> JMETER is a free & open source software given by Apache Organization.

-> JMETER is used for performance testing.

-> Performance testing means the process of verifying stability & responsiveness of the application.

-> How our application is responding for different work loads we can verify using JMETER.

-> Using JMETER we can create virtual users to test our application performance.

-> JMETER is a java based desktop application.

-> Using JMETER we can test performance of any web application.

Note: Before giving project delivery to client we need to submit performance testing report.

===============
JMETER Setup
===============

1) Download JMETER software 

URL : https://dlcdn.apache.org//jmeter/binaries/apache-jmeter-5.6.3.zip

2) Extract JMETER zip file

3) Go to JMETER bin folder and run "jmeter.bat" file  (it will open JMETER tool)

====================
Creating Test Plan
====================

1) Right Click on Test plan

			- Add Threads 
			- Add Thread Group
			- Enter Thread/users count

2) Right Click on Thread Group   (For sampler)

			- Add Sampler
				- Http Request
				- Add Server IP, Port Number, URL Pattern			

3) Right Click on Thread Group (For Listerns)

			- Add Listener
				- Add View Results Tree
				- Add Summary Report

4) Save the test and run the test (filename.jmx)

5) Verify the results (we can change thread group count and we can test it).


======================
JMETER Best Practise
======================

-> Create the TEST in GUI mode and run the test in CLI mode.

   Ex:  jmeter -n -t test-plan.jmx -l test-results.jtl

-> After test execution complete we can import JTL file into JMETER summary report to see the test results.   

===================================
Root causes for performance issue
===================================

1) System Resources Very Low

2) Network issue

3) Database Query Execution taking more time

4) Unwanted loops and conditions in code

Note: Industry Standard Avg response time for a request is 3 secs.
